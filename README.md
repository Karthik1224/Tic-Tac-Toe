# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a Java program that implements the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe using JavaFX, which is a GUI toolkit for Java. 
The program uses a BorderPane layout to create the main window, and it has a grid of nine buttons representing the game board. 
Players can click on the buttons to make their moves, and the program checks for a winner or a tie after each move.
The program also keeps track of the score of each player, displayed at the bottom of the window using an HBox layout. 
The labels for each player's score are updated as the game progresses. The program uses an Alert dialog box to announce the winner or a tie at the end of the game.
